# Data Source

The final dataset used in this analysis comprises of PIT-tag observations of natural-origin adult steelhead (newly or previously tagged) trapped at the Lower Granite Dam (LGD) adult ladder during spawn years 2010 - 2024 and later detected on the spawning grounds at instream PIT-tag detection systems. We generate the dataset by first compiling a list of PIT-tag observations for adult steelhead with *valid* PIT-tag codes collected at the LGD adult trap between July 1 and June 30 of each spawn year [@Baum2023; @Ogden2020]. All phenotypic natural-origin fish (e.g., present adipose fin and absence of a coded-wire tag) are included as part of the *valid* tag list. Adipose fin intact hatchery-origin fish are identified using parentage-based tagging [@Steele2013; @Steele2019; @Baum2023] and are excluded from the *valid* tag list. 

A PIT-tag code was considered *valid* if the adult steelhead was trapped while ascending the LGD fish ladder during a systematic subsampling period, had a fork length (FL) greater than 30 cm, and was not missing potential covariate fields (e.g., fork length, sex, genetic stock, age) within the LGD trapping database [@Baum2023]. Once the valid tag list was developed, we retrieved all PIT-tag interrogations for each code using the complete tag history query from [PTAGIS](https://www.ptagis.org). Observations were then processed using the statistical programming language R [@R-base] and the [PITcleanr](https://kevinsee.github.io/PITcleanr/) package [@See2024]. PIT-tag observations and data processing scripts are maintained within the [SnakeRiverFishStatus](https://github.com/NPTfisheries/SnakeRiverFishStatus) GitHub repository.

The full complete tag history was initially processed using the `PITcleanr::compression()` function [@See2024]. This function, along with a supplied configuration file, collapsed multiple PIT-tag interrogations at the same location and within a similar time frame into a single record, retaining only essential information: the PIT-tag code, observation location (i.e., node), and the minimum and maximum timestamps of observations at that location (i.e., PIT-tag arrays or sites) or any single geographic location of interest. For instance, all PIT-tag detection sites at Bonneville Dam (e.g., BCC, B2J, etc.) were merged into a single node, while LGD sites were categorized into a downstream migration node (GRJ, GRS) and an upstream migration node (GRA, LGRLDR, LGR). All detections upstream of LGD remained distinct to facilitate assignment of detections to specific spawning locations and identify movement direction. Finally, we truncated the dataset to include only observations occurring after an upstream-migrating steelhead was first detected at the LGD adult trap, excluding all juvenile and pre-return adult observations.

The resulting dataset consists of PIT-tag observations from a random sample of adult steelhead migrating past LGD and all subsequent detections of fish migrating during three distinct life stages: upstream towards spawning areas (spawners), downstream post-spawning (kelt), and returning upstream through the hydrosystem (repeat spawners). A simple rule set was applied to classify observations to each life stage using functions in the [SnakeRiverKelt](https://github.com/NPTfisheries/SnakeRiverKelt) GitHub repository. The spawning stage was assigned to all observations before the fish's last and furthest upstream movement. The kelt stage was assigned to observations occurring at least five days after the last upstream spawner movement, observations indicating a downstream movement, and any detection at Columbia and lower Snake River hydro-system facilities after April 20. The repeat spawner stage was assigned to all observations following the first upstream movement in any spawn year beyond the fish's initial spawn year.

In the `r n_distinct(df$spawn_yr)` years of observation data, we have observed `r prettyNum(dim(df)[1], big.mark = ",")` PIT-tagged adult steelhead at Snake River spawning locations. Tables \@ref(tab:data-year) and \@ref(tab:data-pop) show the number of these unique PIT-tagged spawners for each spawn year and within each Snake River population upstream of LGD. Additionally, the tables include the sum of unique kelt observations at LGD and observations of kelt downstream (i.e., below) of LGD.

```{r data-year, tab.cap = "Natural and hatchery origin PIT-tagged steelhead observed as spawners upstream of Lower Granite Dam (LGD) at instream PIT-tag detection systems and subsequent detections of kelt at Lower Snake and Columbia River hydrosystem facilities."}

The largest (i.e., greatest fork length) spawners typiclly occur in the Lochsa River (CRLOC-s), SF Salmon River (SFMAI-s), South Fork Clearwater River (CRSFC-s), Lolo Creek (CRLOL-s), Selway River (CRSEL-s), Sesech River (SFSEC-s) and Middle Fork Salmon River ((MFUMA-s and MFBIG-s) populations (Figure \@ref(fig:length-plot)). The proportion of females returning to each population is lowest in the Little Salmon River (SRLSR-s) and upper mainstem Salmon River (SRUMA-s) populations and highest in the Pahsimeroi (SRPAH-s) and Panther Creek (SRPAN-s) populations (Figure \@ref(fig:sex-plot)).

# Analysis

We estimated post-spawn steelhead survival to LGD using a Cormack-Jolly-Seber (CJS) model [@lebreton_modeling_1992]. The likelihood function for an individual \( i \) in group \( g \) (e.g., a specific spawn year or population) follows:

\[
L = \prod_{i=1}^{n} \prod_{t=1}^{T} P(y_{it} | \phi^g, p^g)
\]

where, \( y_{it} = 1 \) if individual \( i \) is observed at time \( t \), and \( y_{it} = 0 \) if the individual was not observed. \( \phi_t^g \) is the probability of survival from \( t \) to \( t+1 \) for group \( g \), and \( p_t^g \) is the probability of detection at \( t \), given the individual is alive.

Since spawn year and population may explain variation in survival and detection probabilities, we incorporated these as fixed effects in the model using a logit-link and the general structure:

\[
\text{logit}(\phi_t) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 (\text{spawn year}) + \beta_2 (\text{population}) + \beta_3 (\text{spawn year} \times \text{population})
\]

\[
\text{logit}(p_t) = \alpha_0 + \alpha_1 (\text{spawn year}) + \alpha_2 (\text{population}) + \alpha_3 (\text{spawn year} \times \text{population})
\]

where, \( \beta_0, \beta_1, \beta_2, \beta_3 \) are coefficients for survival (\(\phi\)) and \( \alpha_0, \alpha_1, \alpha_2, \alpha_3 \) are coefficients for detection (\( p \)). The interaction term (\(\beta_3, \alpha_3\)) tests whether survival and detection probabilities vary differently by spawn year and population combinations.

We fit multiple models with different variations of spawn year and population fixed effects, and then determined the best-fitting model after comparing candidate models with Akaike’s Information Criterion (AIC) [@akaike_new_1974]. AIC is calculated as:

\[
AIC = -2 \log L + 2K
\]

where, \( L \) is the likelihood of the model given the data and \( K \) is the number of estimated parameters. The model with the lowest AIC value was selected as the most parsimonious and best-fitting model.

All models were fit using the `marked::cmr()` [@laake_marked_2013] function in R [@R-base]. 

# Results

The best fitting CJS model included terms for spawn year and population for estimating survival and only spawn year for estimating detection probabilities (Table \@ref(tab:mod-results)). Figures \@ref(fig:det-plot) and \@ref(fig:suv-plot) show the estimated detection and survival probabilities for the best fitting model. Table \@ref(tab:avg-sur-tab) and Figure \@ref(fig:avg-sur-plot) provide average survival estimates conditioned on population and marginalized over spawn years [@casella_statistical_2021].
