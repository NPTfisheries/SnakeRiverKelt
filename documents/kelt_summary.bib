	abstract = {A guide to data collection, modeling and inference strategies for biological survey data using Bayesian and classical statistical methods.This book describes a general and flexible framework for modeling and inference in ecological systems based on hierarchical models, with a strict focus on the use of probability models and parametric inference. Hierarchical models represent a paradigm shift in the application of statistics to ecological inference problems because they combine explicit models of ecological system structure or dynamics with models of how ecological systems are observed. The principles of hierarchical modeling are developed and applied to problems in population, metapopulation, community, and metacommunity systems. The book provides the first synthetic treatment of many recent methodological advances in ecological modeling and unifies disparate methods and procedures.The authors apply principles of hierarchical modeling to ecological problems, including * occurrence or occupancy models for estimating species distribution* abundance models based on many sampling protocols, including distance sampling* capture-recapture models with individual effects* spatial capture-recapture models based on camera trapping and related methods* population and metapopulation dynamic models* models of biodiversity, community structure and dynamics* Wide variety of examples involving many taxa (birds, amphibians, mammals, insects, plants)* Development of classical, likelihood-based procedures for inference, as well asBayesian methods of analysis* Detailed explanations describing the implementation of hierarchical models using freely available software such as R and WinBUGS* Computing support in technical appendices in an online companion web site},

	abstract = {Anthropogenic impacts on riverine systems have, in part, led to management concerns regarding the population status of species using these systems. In an effort to assess the efficacy of restoration actions, and in order to improve monitoring of species of concern, managers have turned to PIT (passive integrated transponder) tag studies with in-stream detectors to monitor movements of tagged individuals throughout river networks. However, quantifying movements in a river network using PIT tag data with incomplete coverage and imperfect detections presents a challenge. We propose a flexible Bayesian analytic framework that models the imperfectly detected movements of tagged individuals in a nested PIT tag array river network. This model structure provides probabilistic estimates of up-stream migration routes for each tagged individual based on a set of underlying nested state variables. These movement estimates can be converted into abundance estimates when an estimate of abundance is available for a location within the river network. We apply the model framework to data from steelhead (Oncorhynchus mykiss) in the Upper Columbia River basin and evaluate model performance (precision/variance of simulated population sizes) as a function of population tagging rates and PIT tag array detection probability densities within the river system using a simulation framework. This simulation framework provides both model validation (precision) and the ability to evaluate expected performance improvements (variance) due to changes in tagging rates or PIT receiver array configuration. We also investigate the impact of different network configurations on model estimates. Results from such investigations can help inform decisions regarding future monitoring and management.},

	abstract = {We studied movement of a native salmonid, white-spotted char (Salvelinus leucomaenis), in a 1-km tributary in northern Hokkaido, Japan, in May–July 2018. Based on physical mark–recapture of 501 unique individuals and detection by mobile PIT antenna over monthly intervals, a majority of ﬁsh (70\%–80\%) stayed within 60 m of previously released locations, demonstrating what appeared to be restricted movement patterns. However, ﬁxed PIT antenna data showed that as much as 17\% of marked individuals emigrated from the study area during the 2-month study period. Probability of emigration did not depend on where in the 1-km segment individuals had been released, indicating that emigration likely represented long-distance movement. Once emigrants made a decision to emigrate, they left the tributary within 1–3 median days by moving downstream in a unidirectional manner, based on detections at a total of three antenna arrays deployed throughout the tributary. Our multiscale analysis provided strong support for co-existence of short- and long-distance movement patterns, and we conclude that movement data at multiple spatial scales complement each other to characterize population-scale movement.},

	abstract = {Many iteroparous fishes spawn after skipping one or more yearly cycles, which impacts recruitment estimates used for fisheries management and conservation. The physiological mechanisms underlying the development of consecutive and skip spawning life histories in fishes are not well understood. In salmonids, lipid energy reserves and/or growth are thought to regulate the initiation of reproductive maturation during a critical period {\textasciitilde}1 year prior to spawning. The fasting spawning migration of summer-run steelhead trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) results in significant depletion of energy reserves during the proposed critical period for repeat spawning. To determine whether and when lipid energy reserves and growth influence repeat spawning, measures of lipid energy reserves, growth rate and reproductive development were tracked in female steelhead trout from first to second spawning as a consecutive or skip spawner in captivity. Plasma triglyceride (TG) levels and growth rate were elevated by 10 weeks after spawning in reproductive (i.e. consecutive spawning) versus non-reproductive (i.e. skip spawning) individuals. Muscle lipid (ML) levels, condition factor and plasma estradiol levels increased at later time points. The early differences in plasma TG levels and increases in growth rate are attributable to differential rates of feeding and assimilation between the groups following spawning. A year after spawning, plasma TG levels, MLs and growth rate decreased in consecutive spawners, attributable to transfer of lipid reserves into the ovary. During the year prior to second spawning, energy reserves and plasma estradiol levels were higher in reproductive skip spawners versus consecutive spawners, reflecting the energy deficit after first spawning. These results suggest that the decision to initiate ovarian recrudescence occurs by 10 weeks after first spawning and are consistent with the differences in energy reserves acquired following spawning being a consequence of that decision. This information will increase the success of conservation projects reconditioning post-spawning summer-run steelhead trout.},

From 2001 to 2011, we captured a total of 9,738 downstream-migrating kelts at an irrigation diversion facility, an average about 27\% of each annual wild steelhead return. Captured kelts were reared for 4.5–10 months in an artificial environment, treated for diseases and parasites, and fed both krill and pellets. Surviving reconditioned fish were released into the Yakima River during the peak of the upstream migration of prespawn steelhead. Reconditioned steelhead kelts were predominantly ({\textgreater}92\%) female. Annual survival to release ranged from 20\% to 62\% and averaged 38\% over the course of the study, the surviving reconditioned kelts showing increases in FL, weight, and Fulton's K condition factor compared with their preconditioning status. Kelts in good condition and those with bright coloration at the time of collection were more likely to survive than those of poorer status at collection. Postrelease timing of upstream migration by reconditioned kelts was spread over several months and correlated well with the run timing of prespawn migrants upstream. The empirical results we observed demonstrate the potential for kelt reconditioning to provide recovery benefits for repeat spawning imperiled wild populations in highly developed river systems.

	abstract = {Adult summer-run steelhead Oncorhynchus mykiss overwinter in freshwater for several months prior to spawning. In systems supporting mixed populations of fisheries and conservation importance, understanding the distribution and survival of pre- and postspawn fish is necessary for informed management. The upper Columbia River supports hatchery-origin components valued by anglers, natural-origin components of conservation concern, and temporary strays from downstream populations. We used radiotelemetry and PIT telemetry to monitor the behavior, distribution, and survival of adult steelhead during fall, overwintering, spawning, and postspawn periods, with a focus on use of the main stem versus four major tributaries. Adult steelhead (N = 807) were tagged at Priest Rapids Dam in 2015 and 2016. One-fifth of steelhead fell back below Priest Rapids Dam and did not reascend. A slight majority of tagged steelhead that overwintered upstream of Priest Rapids Dam did so in main-stem reservoirs (54\%; N = 548). Overwintering in the main-stem Columbia River was more likely for later-arriving steelhead and was concentrated in the upstream-most reservoir. Winter tributary use was highest in the Wenatchee (26\%; 2016) and Methow (18\%; 2015) rivers, whereas no steelhead overwintered in the Entiat River. Harvest of hatchery-origin steelhead was 18\% in 2015 and was near zero in 2016, when the fishery was suspended due to low adult returns. After accounting for reported harvest, annual overwinter survival did not differ between main-stem and tributary habitats, and relatively low adjusted survival of hatchery-origin steelhead in 2015 suggested unreported harvest. In contrast to low iteroparity rates ({\textless}3\%), the majority of postspawn steelhead (56.5\%) exited tributaries as kelts; kelt survival to Bonneville Dam was 65\% in 2016 and 23\% in 2017. Collectively, the results highlight the importance of understanding patterns of habitat use and mortality in steelhead populations when managers are faced with balancing harvest and conservation goals.},

	abstract = {The understanding of the dynamics of animal populations and of related ecological and evolutionary issues frequently depends on a direct analysis of life history parameters. For instance, examination of trade—offs between reproduction and survival usually rely on individually marked animals, for which the exact time of death is most often unknown, because marked individuals cannot be followed closely through time. Thus, the quantitative analysis of survival studies and experiments must be based on capture—recapture (or resighting) models which consider, besides the parameters of primary interest, recapture or resighting rates that are nuisance parameters. Capture—recapture models oriented to estimation of survival rates are the result of a recent change in emphasis from earlier approaches in which population size was the most important parameter, survival rates having been first introduced as nuisance parameters. This emphasis on survival rates in capture—recapture models developed rapidly in the 1980s and used as a basic structure the Cormack—Jolly—Seber survival model applied to an homogeneous group of animals, with various kinds of constraints on the model parameters. These approaches are conditional on first captures; hence they do not attempt to model the initial capture of unmarked animals as functions of population abundance in addition to survival and capture probabilities. This paper synthesizes, using a common framework, these recent developments together with new ones, with an emphasis on flexibility in modeling, model selection, and the analysis of multiple data sets. The effects on survival and capture rates of time, age, and categorical variables characterizing the individuals (e.g., sex) can be considered, as well as interactions between such effects. This 'analysis of variance' philosophy emphasizes the structure of the survival and capture process rather than the technical characteristics of any particular model. The flexible array of models encompassed in this synthesis uses a common notation. As a result of the great level of flexibility and relevance achieved, the focus is changed from fitting a particular model to model building and model selection. The following procedure is recommended: (1) start from a global model compatible with the biology of the species studied and with the design of the study, and assess its fit; (2) select a more parsimonious model using Akaike's Information Criterion to limit the number of formal tests; (3) test for the most important biological questions by comparing this model with neighboring ones using likelihood ratio tests; and (4) obtain maximum likelihood estimates of model parameters with estimates of precision. Computer software is critical, as few of the models now available have parameter estimators that are in closed form. A comprehensive table of existing computer software is provided. We used RELEASE for data summary and goodness—of—fit tests and SURGE for iterative model fitting and the computation of likelihood ratio tests. Five increasingly complex examples are given to illustrate the theory. The first, using two data sets on the European Dipper (Cinclus cinclus), tests for sex—specific parameters, explores a model with time—dependent survival rates, and finally uses a priori information to model survival allowing for an environmental variable. The second uses data on two colonies of the Swift (Apus apus), and shows how interaction terms can be modeled and assessed and how survival and recapture rates sometimes partly counterbalance each other. The third shows complex variation in survival rates across sexes and age classes in the roe deer (Capreolus capreolus), with a test of density dependence in annual survival rates. The fourth is an example of experimental density manipulation using the common lizard (Lacerta vivipara). The last example attempts to examine a large and complex data set on the Greater Flamingo (Phoenicopterus ruber), where parameters are age specific, survival is a function of an environmental variable, and an age × year interaction term is important. Heterogeneity seems present in this example and cannot be adequately modeled with existing theory. The discussion presents a summary of the paradigm we recommend and details issues in model selection and design, and foreseeable future developments.},

We used radiotelemetry to investigate migration rates, downstream passage routes, and success of adult steelhead kelts migrating past lower Snake River and Columbia River dams during the springs of 2001 and 2002. Seaward-migrating kelts were collected, radio-tagged, and volitionally released from the juvenile bypass facilities at Lower Granite Dam (LGR) on the Snake River and at McNary Dam (McN) and John Day Dam (JDD) on the Columbia River. Migration success rates from LGR to the study area exit (8 km east of Portland, Oregon) were poorer during the low-flow nonspill conditions of 2001 (4.1\%) than in the more typical flow year of 2002 (15.6\%). Kelts tagged and released at Columbia River dams had substantially higher migration success than those released on the Snake River; 59.6\% and 62.3\% of the kelts released at McN and 63.6\% and 80.0\% of those released at JDD were contacted at the study area exit during 2001 and 2002, respectively. Kelt dam passage was predominately via spillways and surface flow routes, and during periods of spill 90.0\% or more kelts typically passed via nonturbine routes. Only 47.2\% of kelts were guided out of turbine intakes by screen systems during nonspill periods. Turbine passage, the primary alternative route during nonspill periods, may be a substantial source of kelt mortality. The poor migration success rate of Snake River kelts in both 2001 and 2002 suggests that additional management (i.e., kelt reconditioning, transportation, or both) may be warranted to boost iteroparity rates in this population.},

	abstract = {Some anadromous salmonids are iteroparous (repeat spawners); however, postspawn individuals are often not considered in management plans because of the lack of long-term studies of this life history. The balance of factors affecting survival between spawns and fecundity of repeat spawners should determine the percentage of iteroparous individuals in a population. Steelhead Oncorhynchus mykiss are capable of iteroparity, but Snake River populations in the interior Columbia River basin in the Pacific Northwest have the lowest iteroparity rates. Managers are interested in augmenting the incidence of iteroparity as a conservation measure. However, there is little information about repeat-spawning steelhead to guide and evaluate management. In this study, we elucidated patterns and characteristics of repeat-spawning steelhead in the Snake River basin. Repeat spawners were overwhelmingly female and were found in all 10 stocks. Most iteroparous fish first spawned after 1 year in the ocean (51.4\%) and skipped a year between spawns (55.4\%). Growth between spawns declined for longer, older steelhead. Survival from the first spawning migration to postspawn emigration increased during the study. However, survival in the Columbia River estuary and Pacific Ocean declined such that overall survival to second spawn varied little. Small females were most likely to survive to a second spawning migration. We hypothesized that iteroparity in Snake River steelhead was constrained by the energetic costs of the spawning migration (distance, elevation, timing, dam passage) combined with a lack of timely postspawn recovery. Hence, survival to second spawning migration is low for Snake River steelhead and most postspawn steelhead needed a full year to recover. Management programs intended to augment the incidence of iteroparity should account for (1) factors that increase stress and metabolic demand on spawning and postspawn fish and (2) factors that increase the time it takes for emigrating kelts to effectively refuel and recover.},

	abstract = {Iteroparity (repeat spawning) is a life history attribute with significant conservation value for at-risk populations of steelhead trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). However, stock-specific rates of iteroparity and abundance of post-spawned steelhead “kelts” can be difficult to monitor in large river systems where multiple populations are commonly encountered as aggregated mixtures. We used genetic mixed-stock analysis (MSA) to determine steelhead origins and tested for stock-specific differences in the prevalence of an iterparous reproductive strategy. Steelhead from the Snake River, USA were sampled as “returns” migrating upstream to spawn and as emigrating post-spawned “kelts”. Fish were assigned between two regions that are characterized by predominant run-type. We observed a larger overall proportion of kelts from region-1 (putative-A run; 82\%) compared to kelts from region-2 (putative B-run; 18\%), but returns from region-2 (30\%) were nearly twice as abundant as kelts. Female kelts were predominant throughout the basin, occurring in similar proportions between regions (72\% region-1, 77\% region-2). The inferred ocean age distribution of kelts was distinct between regions, and regional differences in body size and emigration timing were significant (P \&lt; 0.0001). Although the ocean age-classes for kelts and returns within the same region were similarly distributed, kelts were significantly smaller in average body size compared to returns, and the results were temporally consistent. The association between body size and post-spawn survival suggests that strategies to improve overall recovery of steelhead, such as artificial reconditioning, may achieve greater success by targeting smaller kelts. Moreover, monitoring of post-spawn survival, and repeat spawning potential will likely benefit from MSA to augment demographic information and improve the accuracy of differentiating among specific stocks or regions.},

	abstract = {Stock-specific migration-timing and relative abundance of exploited fish species are critical parameters to estimate for management of mixed stock fisheries. Here, we used parentage-based tagging (PBT) together with mixed stock analyses (MSA) to estimate stock-specific abundance and migration-timing in anadromous adult steelhead (Oncorhynchus mykiss) sampled at Bonneville Dam in the lower Columbia River. Results indicate that natural-origin steelhead was represented by 11 of 13 possible stocks found throughout the Columbia-Snake river basins, while hatchery-origin steelhead was primarily composed of five stocks from the Snake River drainage. Further, migration-timing differentiated stocks and allowed categorization of early, intermediate, and late migrating stocks. Analyses of age and length data for these stocks also showed that late-arriving fish were larger due to older age and originated primarily from the Clearwater River, South Fork Salmon River, and Dworshak Hatchery, all from the Snake River drainage. Sex ratios tended to be skewed towards females and ranged from 51.5 to 68.9\% for hatchery stocks and 60.5–71.8\% for natural-origin stocks. This suggests that anadromous migration is favored by females while males are more likely to residualize in freshwater. Overall, this study demonstrates how the use of PBT in MSA can reveal important stock-specific differences in migration-timing and relative abundance and provides critical information for management of mixed stock fisheries.},

	abstract = {In anadromous salmonids, muscle tissue provides the primary source of energy to support spawning migrations and spawning. We examined changes in the lipid content, protein content, and energy density of white muscle collected from stream-maturing Snake River–Columbia River steelhead Oncorhynchus mykiss during several phases of reproduction. At a basinwide scale, we estimated that between early freshwater entry and postspawning (kelt) emigration, the lipid content of white muscle was reduced by 94\% to levels less than 1\% of wet tissue weight. Lipid was depleted more rapidly than protein during the reproductive cycle and afterward provided the only remaining somatic energy source for the postspawning migration. We found that protein content was consistently higher in sexually mature male steelhead than in females, suggesting that energy allocation prior to reproduction varies between the sexes. In kelts, the lipid content, protein content, and energy density of white muscle were significantly higher in good-condition individuals than in poor-condition fish. Fork length was positively correlated with both protein content and energy density in kelts, suggesting that larger kelts have higher somatic energy than smaller kelts. We found no evidence of significant interannual variation in lipid, protein, and energy density of sexually mature steelhead and steelhead kelts. Postspawning survival of steelhead is likely limited by the low energy density of kelts, and our data lend support to observations of low iteroparity rates in this and other populations of inland stream-maturing steelhead.Received August 7, 2013; accepted October 26, 2013},

Blood plasma samples were analyzed for metrics related to nutritional and osmotic status, and samples of white muscle tissue collected from recent mortalities at weirs were analyzed for proximate constituents. Female kelts from the Situk River had significantly higher plasma cholesterol, triglycerides, glucose and calcium concentrations, all of which suggested higher lipid and energy stores. Additional support for energy limitation in kelts was provided by evaluating the presence of detectable proteins in the plasma. Most all kelts sampled from the Situk River populations had detectable plasma proteins, in contrast to kelts sampled from the Clearwater River tributary populations where 27 \% of kelts from one tributary, and 68 \% of the second tributary were below the limits of detection. We found proximate constituents of kelt mortalities were similar between the Situk and Clearwater River populations, and the lipid fraction of white muscle averaged 0.1 and 0.2 \%. Our findings lend support to the hypothesis that energetic limitations likely affect post-spawn survival in the Clearwater River kelts.},

	abstract = {Steelhead trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) are anadromous and iteroparous, but repeat-spawning rates are generally low. Like other anadromous salmonids, steelhead trout fast during freshwater spawning migrations, but little is known about the changes that occur in vital organs and tissues. We hypothesized that fish capable of repeat-spawning would not undergo the same irreversible degeneration and cellular necrosis documented in semelparous salmon. Using Snake River steelhead trout as a model we used histological analysis to assess the cellular architecture in the pyloric stomach, ovary, liver, and spleen in sexually mature and kelt steelhead trout. We observed 38 \% of emigrating kelts with food or fecal material in the gastrointestinal tract. Evidence of feeding was more likely in good condition kelts, and feeding was associated with a significant renewal of villi in the pyloric stomach. No vitellogenic oocytes were observed in sections of kelt ovaries, but perinucleolar and early/late stage cortical alveolus oocytes were present suggesting iteroparity was possible. We documented a negative correlation between the quantity of perinucleolar oocytes in ovarian tissues and fork length of kelts suggesting that larger steelhead trout may invest more into a single spawning event. Liver and spleen tissues of both mature and kelt steelhead trout had minimal cellular necroses. Our findings indicate that the physiological processes causing rapid senescence and death in semelparous salmon are not evident in steelhead trout, and recovery begins in fresh water. Future management efforts to increase iteroparity in steelhead trout and Atlantic salmon must consider the physiological processes that influence post-spawning recovery.},

We tested the approach using a simulation framework that mimicked several levels of observation error, differences between nighttime passage and re-ascension rates and the possibility of the adult trap being closed for some period of time. Our results demonstrate that the model produced unbiased estimates across all tested scenarios. We also applied this model to empirical data from the Lower Granite Dam to produce estimates of wild, clipped hatchery and unclipped hatchery spring/summer-run Chinook Salmon, Oncorhynchus tshawytscha, and steelhead, O. mykiss, from spawn years 2010-2019.},

	abstract = {Diversity in steelhead Oncorhynchus mykiss (anadromous Rainbow Trout) is often characterized by varying time spent in freshwater and saltwater environments. However, ontogenetic shifts are not often highlighted as an important diversity characteristic in salmonids. Larger water bodies can play a key role in population stability by buffering limited resources in smaller tributary systems. Based on freshwater and saltwater ages of adult steelhead in Fish Creek, Idaho, there were 12 different life history trajectories observed. Juvenile abundance varied from 12,083 (SE = 1,225.7) to 62,463 (SE = 1,753.8), with ages ranging from young of the year (age 0) to 4 years. Adult abundance ﬂuctuated from 17 (SE {\textless} 0.1) to 499 (SE = 67.1), and total age of adults varied from 3 to 7 years. Diversity was most evident in juvenile movement and rearing strategies. We observed four types of movement and rearing pathways in which juveniles either directly migrated to the ocean from Fish Creek or resided for up to three winters in main-stem river habitat in the Clearwater River basin prior to ocean migration. Most juveniles emigrated in the fall at age 2, and most ocean-emigrating smolts were age 3. Subsequently, most juveniles resided for at least one additional winter period before ocean migration. Juvenile diversity was also reﬂected in adult ages; the mean proportion that spent 3 years in freshwater was 0.55 (SE = 0.03), and the mean proportion that spent 2 years in freshwater was 0.41 (SE = 0.03). Adult sex ratio was female biased (mean ± SE = 0.66 ± 0.02), with a higher proportion of females (0.89 ± 0.03) than males (0.65 ± 0.05) residing in the ocean for at least 2 years. Density-dependent mechanisms were evident in juvenile rearing habitat in Fish Creek for cohorts of high female abundance. Population productivity potentials can be met when tributary and main-stem rearing habitat can be utilized, and this will be essential in attaining recovery goals.},

The CJS models can be fitted with MLE using optimization code in R or with Automatic Differentiation Model Builder. The latter allows incorporation of random effects. Some package features include: (i) individual-specific time intervals between sampling occasions, (ii) generation of optimization starting values from generalized linear model approximations and (iii) prediction of demographic parameters associated with unique combinations of individual and time-specific covariates. We demonstrate marked with a commonly analysed European dipper (Cinclus cinclus) data set. The package will be most useful to ecologists with large mark–recapture data sets and many individual covariates.},

	abstract = {The history of the development of statistical hypothesis testing in time series analysis is reviewed briefly and it is pointed out that the hypothesis testing procedure is not adequately defined as the procedure for statistical model identification. The classical maximum likelihood estimation procedure is reviewed and a new estimate minimum information theoretical criterion (AIC) estimate (MAICE) which is designed for the purpose of statistical identification is introduced. When there are several competing models the MAICE is defined by the model and the maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters which give the minimum of AIC defined by AIC = (-2)log-(maximum likelihood) + 2(number of independently adjusted parameters within the model). MAICE provides a versatile procedure for statistical model identification which is free from the ambiguities inherent in the application of conventional hypothesis testing procedure. The practical utility of MAICE in time series analysis is demonstrated with some numerical examples.},
